## Application config management library.

### What's Briefbag for?

Briefbag allows any ruby application to assemble configs `.yml` files, into single `.yml` file for the `development` environment 
or use interact with [Consul's](http://www.consul.io/) distributed key value store

### Does it work in rails?
Yup! In fact, we're using it in all of our rails production apps instead

### How it is work
#### Overview
It works quite easily,
you are a developer and work in the `development` environment, it is more convenient for you to use one `.yml` file with configuration. 
No more `.yml` zoos, or ENV variables -  all in one place.
You just create constant (for example usage) in your application `APPLICATION_CONFIG` and forward.
refer to the desired config as an object. To do this, under the hood, I use [Struct](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.7.5/Struct.html)
therefore, the appeal becomes simpler: `APPLICATION_CONFIG.database.port`

And what if you need to share the configuration file with colleagues, or use this design at other stands - `production` environment. 
Consul comes to the rescue. Thanks to him, you can act config and undress in different stands.

#### Notifications:
If you use `.yml` .You will see: 
> NOTICE! Your app is using configs from yml file

If you use Consul. You will see: 

> NOTICE! Your app is using configs from consul now
        If you want to use local configs. you need to create config file. Just run `rake settings:consul2yml`


If you don't have access to consul (for example VPN or bad connections)
You will see:
>ALARM! You are trying to get consul config, but you have no consul connection.
        Please! connect to VPN or check consul configuration
